        I have purchased this Les Paul Body as Well as The Les Paul neck and the Emg 81/85 combo to<br>
        make my own guitar and it turned out amazingly. It sounds great and plays very smoothly. I am<br>
        very happy with the result and would highly recommend them. Its a really good guitar and has <br>
        a very good tone.
